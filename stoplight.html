	<ul>
		<li>
		One good time for using these boards is when waiting in a waiting room or when waiting for a bus.
		</li>
		<li>
		On a stoplight, red, yellow and green cards indicate time passing, whereas on a countdown board, numbers 1-5 indicate time passing.
		</li>
		<li>
		With both stoplights and countdown boards, the adult manipulates the board, reflecting the passage of time.

	</ul>
